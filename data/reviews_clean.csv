1439028,"Even though I've never met Miles during my stay, he did help me a lot. When I accidentally locked the room while leaving the key inside, Miles kindly came to help me open the door. And the transportation was very convenient! However,  there were two flaws. One was the bathroom and kitchen were always in a mess cuz other housemates didn't clean their part. The other was one of the housemates was not that friendly. But fortunately, that person was about to move out.",50

1439028,"Unfortunate experience.
I got highly alergic to the dog from the first minutes I entered in the appartment. These ""hypo-alergic"" dogs aren't alergy-free on everyone, so you must consider that there is no garanty that you won't get alergy if you have a minimum of sensitivity. 
.
The place had a perfect location for me, as I was taking a class just 5 minutes walk from there. Unfortunaly, alergies and ashtma got pretty strong after less than an hour after my arrival, so there was no way I could stay longer, for serious health issues.
Although I made my reservation for 5 night only 24 hours before I check in, very last minute, the host refused to revise their cancellation policy considering my health issu and charge my the regular cancelation fees, which is only half of what I paid.... plus of cours airbnb fees.
In other words, I got a tiny refund of what I invested for 5 nights in which I didn't stay there, despite a last minute reservation and most of all, despite a health issu.
.
From my point of view, this is unconsiderate and a way to make money no matter what the visitor is going throught. ""Business is business""....
.
The distant, cold way I felt from Samantha (Miles's roomate, the one who is actually staying there and ""dealed"" with me all the way throught) intereacting with me from the first moment with met, Not provide me a clean pair of sheets on a made bed (I had to ask for it) also made me feel that they are doing a business no matter the human encounter. That is an unfortunate experience I wish would have turned otherwise, but I wish Miles and Samantha all the best.",50
1850695,"The apartment was exactly like the pictures, really close to the subway so it was really easy to move around the city. The room is really big and bright. The only thing is that the heater is old so it makes some noise at night but if your a heavy sleeper you won't even notice it. Roberto was nice he was not at the apartment but he answered all our questions really fast.",50

1850695,"The place was unclean. Bed was just a mattress on the floor, sheets were all wrinkled and sheets seemed unwashed. The blanket that was provided had visible stains on it, so I don’t think it was washed. Towels (only two for two people) were very old and didn’t seem fresh. There was hair left in the bathtub and on the floor in the bathroom (on the tile walls too). Kitchen sick was disgusting and had some pieces of food left in it. Bathroom sink was dirty too. The sofa had some hair and crumbs on it. It was really disappointing that a host rented his place knowing it wasn’t cleaned before.",50

1871261,"Points positifs : 
Emplacement idéal en plein de centre de Manhattan pour aller dans le nord comme dans le sud ! A 3 blocks de Flatiron et a 5 de l'Empire State Buiding ! 
Points négatifs : locataires pas très accueillants mais surtout locataires pas propres du tout ! 
Poussière dans tous les recoins, salle de bains d'une malpropreté inexcusable pour des jeunes gens ! 
Ils ne font jamais le ménage car les WC et la baignoire sont dans un état insalubre ! 
C'est vraiment dommage car la chambre pour 2 est idéale mais on était la que pour dormir et prendre une douche et sans pomme de douche (avec dégoût je préfère être honnête) !!! 
Pour le prix, on aurait pu au moins avoir de la propreté et un accueil souriant !",50
1871261,"Asuka was nice and easygoing with us during our stay. Her room is pretty neat and the bed size is more than enough for two people (and comfortable). The overall hygiene of the apartment is alright, though not the best. It's pretty worth its value",50

2515634,"The host wasn’t too attentive that our check in was after 3PM. We arrived at 4PM. To be fair, he sent us a message around 8AM in the morning to ask when we would arrive. I missed this message, due to notification settings on the app. This is definitely my fault. But I was hoping to get a phone call if he had a sense of urgency, I was not expecting him to let his friend stay in the space we paid for already. He was also not even at the location. I’d presume you’d be at the location you’re renting out around the time of check in... In general he seemed to have a decent attitude though! So I appreciate it.

Responses were not too urgent at first, which can be understandable! However, he then told me because I didn’t respond to his earlier 8 AM message that he was going to let his friend stay the night. This is when it became a BIG problem to us. I was willing to wait for him to come back and only wanted an estimate of when that would be. But he didn’t let us know, out of the blue he told us he let a friend stay instead. If this was the case, I was hoping he’d cancel our reservation in a timely manner. Or call me to get ahold of me ASAP. Why let your friend stay in the room we had already paid for? To be fair, he later offered to let us stay in the room still, but with his friend there (not in the room with us). It would have been an uncomfortable situation for us still. We don’t know him or his friend and it’s not terms we had agreed to beforehand. Luckily we had gotten a full refund. Considering he knew he had a reservation, I was hoping he’d set time aside or have someone greet us maybe. It’s my first time using AirBnB and it was kind of a mixed experience, but I appreciate the AirBnB customer service ! They even paid half of our awesome hotel that night. My only advice is, if you want to get in touch with future visitors - please call them if it’s urgent. Don’t just let a friend stay in the space without properly informing people who paid for the space in advance. It’s asking for trouble and it was kind of suspicious for us. He has a convenient location. I can’t comment on the cleanliness or anything else because we never got in the space. He asked also what the gender of my friend would be - which also didn’t make sense to me. We are paying for the room, I don’t think it matters. We just wanted somewhere safe to retreat after celebrating the New Year, but we probably dodged a bullet. We still had a good time in NY irregardless! He may definitely have good intentions, but this was really crazy for us lol.",40
3646551,"I wish I had some good things as this was the first airbnb that needed alot of attention.  The location is good, wifi was fine and the bed was comfortable.  Eran could not acommodate our red eye flight because they needed to have a cleaner come in, so we had to take a taxi to a family member in Brooklyn with 5 pieces of luggage.  Although Eran offered to have us take our luggage to their office, we would have still needed to take two taxi's either way.  We were met at 4:30pm by Tereza.  The picture of this Gramercy-Reno apartment is quite deceiving.  It is not light, although it did have three lamps which we kept on when Tereza got light bulbs for them.  The nice white rug in the picture was taken out because it was dirty and never returned in the 5 weeks we were in the apartment. Bathroom was dirty with old dirt around pipes and door was off the hinge. I had something fall under the bed and was disgusted by the clumps of dust and dirt.  Oven was broken, could only use cooktop, oven was replaced after 4 weeks.  Cable was not working and when I let Eran know, he questioned my credibility, Tereza did get us a new cable box after two weeks. Three of the beautiful floor boards were falling through the floor and I caught my slipper on it which ripped my slipper.  After 4 weeks they did replace the two that caused a problem. My first day in the apartment I was not able to leave because I could not lock the door, the key was very difficult to get in and out and lock and got stuck.  I texted them to come to my rescue but they never did, so I sat home all day.  My husband remedied the problem by buying WD40 and then the key worked. They never addressed it. My husband and I are homeowners and we were not tourists but waiting to move into our new house.  We are quite experienced with airbnb and did not feel this was worth our money.",30
3646551,"Horrible!!! Do not stay here. He was totally unavailable to give us the keys. The internet didn't work when we arrived and 48 hours later he finally came to ""fix it."" Come to find out - he was stealing internet from his neighbor and didn't have it for the apartment. By ""cable"" he means two channels. If you want anything aside from public access, he'll charge you for it. He said we couldn't get in because he was having the unit cleaned. When we arrived it was disgusting. Fruit flies everywhere - gross floors & things spattered on the wall in the kitchen. The bathroom had black mold in the shower. The lock was broken on the front door. Unsafe, un clean, don't stay here! A ton of money for a shit hole listing. We were going to stay for three months and cancelled for three days.",30
4244476,"Lori was a really nice host. She was easy to get in contact with and had clear instructions about how to use the apartment etc... However, the apartment was filthy dirty. Both me and a friend I was traveling with were extremely disappointed and grossed out that there was not any cleaning done ahead of time. Even the simplest of things were not clean. It made the stay really hard so we made sure to spend as little time as possible in the apartment because it was just plain gross. I was really disappointed in this experience overall. Hopefully she will clean for her next guests.",20
4295603,"Our stay was a mixed bag. We loved the flexibility of a place to stay for medium term in New York - something not that easy to find anywhere. The apartment looked exactly like the listing, very attractive and well kept up. We were familiar with the location and although it was a little far from everything, it was still close to McGorlick park and some fine restaurants. We also found the live-in super to be very helpful with our move-in and dealing with any issues that came up.

Now for the bad. The internet was a constant problem. I work from home often as a result of my job and need a good connection. At first we were able to have a dedicate Time Warner modem. Unfortunately, every month it seemed that the owner was not paying the Time Warner bill and we'd have service cut off for a few days. This caused a huge issue with my job as I'm not always able to come into the office and secure a connection. In the end, the Time Warner modem was removed and replaced with a MUCH worse connection that we couldn't use. We tried working with the management to deal with this issue but we never got a straight answer or a satisfactory solution. In addition, the walls were very thin and for the first month or so we were woken up at all hours by our partying neighbors. This became less of an issue when more normal folks moved in.

For the price, I don't think I could say I'd recommend this place. On the otherhand, we couldn't find anything better on short notice and the place was very nice, cleaned regularly and decently located.

5259407,"Eran was a well meaning host and the apartment was in a great neighborhood. Unfortunately, we had the bad luck to have a few things go wrong (loss of Internet, broken front door knob, broken AC). Eran's responsiveness was sincere but less than effective. Given the price we paid, we expected a more professional management service.",40
5259407,"Bad experience all together..
In a nutshell:
Leading up to arrival, Eran's communication was satisfactory at best.
One arrival, the place didn't look anywhere as good as it did in the pictures. Looked dull and run down.
Attention to detail with cleanliness and building standards were non existent. 
Shower had just been re done with the drain being blocked and shards of aluminum and mess still left over. 
Noise levels were excessive - it felt like we were literally sleeping on the street.
Bad experience all together. 
However, made better by the great resolution dispute team at Airbnb who refunded basically our entire stay (50nights) and were completely understanding. A very good reflection for the Airbnb brand.",40

5842819,"Nice apartment with a very nice roommate. I didn't see Auminea as she was in in Australia but she was very nice and helpful over email, as was her roomate. He helped me with my bag upstairs, he lent me clean sheets when I arrived as the ones on the bed weren't clean, and he answered any questions about the area I had super fast. 
Fantastic location, literally 2 mins walk to the L, Bedford Ave is one stop from Manhattan. 
The room and apartment were not that clean, a lot of dust and hair.. more than I would find acceptable, others may not.
The person in the apartment above sounds like a herd of elephants and seems to walk across her flat all night. There was a rave outside the window which started at midnight and was still going when I left for the work the next morning which meant zero sleep. There is also a high school opposite the window, very noisy if you want to sleep in on a week day. Not a great apartment for sleeping. 
The room doesn't look quite like the photo as there are packing boxes lining the wall, plus there is no way to hold the curtains open so it was hard to let natural light in.
Excellent location for Bedford ave, if noise and super clean don't bother you it's a great room.

6225935,"A very good apartment for a stay of a night or two: desk and bed, good wifi, clean bathroom, washing machine, and unintrusive roommates. Think twice though about staying longer than that though, especially if you hope to cook: the kitchen was dirty and very poorly equipped (not ""fully equipped"" as the listing specifies). Only after insisting upon being supplied with a bare minimum of kitchenware did the host provide me with a single plate, a bowl, a fork, a spoon, a pot, a small pan, and a spatula, as well as a single coffee mug to drink from.

One point for light sleepers: the walls are thin, and every door in the apartment creaks loudly. If any of the roommates decide to come home late or make a midnight snack, you will be woken up.",30
6225935,Neighbourhood was great. Host was not present and did not make it clear to her guests about how and where to collect keys and was very hard to get hold of on day of arrival.

6423799,"Maurine has a very cute apartment in a great location in NYC.  Check in was at 12pm and we told her we would arrive around 1:30pm. The night before our arrival, she asked that we come at 2:30pm.  We arranged to drop off our luggage and return later since we were coming straight from the train, but this was inconvenient.  When we met, Maurine was very friendly.  Unfortunately, after she left, we realized that the shower was not very clean and not draining correctly.  There was also a lot of mildew.  My husband tried to take a shower but the water would not drain.  The neighbor downstairs actually had a leak into her apartment. We moved out after 1 night and found a last minute hotel room.  We agreed to pay for one night + cleaning fee. Maurine was understanding, however when it came to refunding us for our stay - we were only offered 68% of our fee back when we only stayed 1 of our scheduled 6 nights.  This is very disappointing given that the hotel room was much more expensive.  I would not stay at Maurine's again.  If you do, bring shower shoes.",40

6887405,"Staying in Rob's apartment wasn't as pleasant as I expected to be. The description was accurate, except the ""clean"" part. Unfortunately, Rob wasn't present (he was in a Brazil) and his roommates were a little bit messy. 

When I first come to his apartment, there were some stains on the bed sheets. Rob responded to me that it's a sweat stain probably. Luckily we had our own sleeping bags so we don't have to deal with this. 

The bathroom was simply disgusting. The toilet wasn't working at all. I had to fix it twice BY MYSELF because Rob's roommates apparently didn't care. Once, someone peed into the toilet but didn't bother with flushing it. So I come to the bathroom and there was a toilet full of urine. I know that's not Rob's mistake, but he's the one who's renting an apartment and if he can't assure that his roommates are neat, he shouldn't rent the apartment at all.",20

7024079,"I stayed here for 1 week and it was fine for 50 bucks per night, still the apartment was very dirty and they really need to work on that bath was not that bad but kitchen was terrible. But what is super is the amount of markets, pharmacies and restaurants near the place and is super close to the subway I even took the sub to the airport with my 2 huge bags. Mifan was very understanding and always polite and her roommate too she did apologize about the space been dirty. The room itself has space enough and the air cobditioner really helped me with July weather!",40
7024079,"When I came,I paid for a cleaning fee But downside is that the room wasn't cleaned up before I came, even the trash was not cleared. The bedroom was decent, for the price you pay. Plenty of hair here and there on the bed from the previous renters I guess..
 Accessible location wise, toilets were awfully dirty, horrible horrible toilets... The stench of pee could me smelled by the corridor.
Black marks and dirt on the toilet floor, very poorly maintained unlike in the pictures.
As mifan was away I communicated with her room mate, and asked if there was going to be anyone who cleans the toilet after a guest comes but she did not reply, And also informed Mifan about the condition but she did not reply either. I really couldn't stand the sight of the toilet, the flush was not working.
 The apartment conditions in terms of sanitation and hygiene, is not up to my expectations. Safety wise I felt very insecure as well, As on the third day someone tried to Come into my room 3 times ,in the middle of the day when I was still  inside my room, without notifying me and they were two males when mifan said  there were only 2 females living in the apartments and so I decided to leave the apartment early and airbnb was helpful and understanding towards the circumstances.",40
7501794,"Well, this definitely has been the most challenging place to stay that i have found thru airbnb.

First, the apartment is small but enough to fit 2 or 3 people. Small kitchenette, one sofa at the living room, and one air mattress that we could never set up to work right. No space to hang anything, and actually, looked like they didn't expect to receive anybody even though we confirmed booking since first week of the month. The place looked messy, with stuff lying around everywhere, but the worst part is, beneath the messines, it was dirty. 
Even though i priorly asked for a set of clean sheets and clean towels, i got them, but definetely not clean. Had to bought new towels, because the ones we got smelled funny.
Every space of the house was at best dusty, at worst filled with women hair. By the second day we had to sweep and mop the entire place to feel a little comfortable, but really didn't help. We left by the 4th day. I know the price wasn't high, but to pay 25US for the cleanliness was a bad joke.

On the bright side location is awesome. Harlem is a really nice place to stay. You will find a store or bodega in every corner, the 16th st subway is a couple blocks away, and around on Frederick douglas Av. you can find a bunch of restaurants, bars, cafes and some stores, great place to hang around at night. Central park is 10 min. walking distance.
You see a lot of locals hanging around on the streets all day and night, but nobody messes with you, i never felt unsafe or threatened. If you want to meet the real harlem, walk up north some 5 minutes to 125th avenue where you can find cinemas, stores and chain restaurants, and mostly the local harlem flavor.

Towel was of a ridiculous size (I couldn't dry myself after shower)
Curtains were too short to cover the bottom of the Windows.
Bathroom is in a pity state: mold in the bath and the host let tons of hair in the bath after washing her hairs which was quite disgusting.

8807842,"A few days before arriving, Rebecca asked if would mind staying in her other loft space down the street from where this listing was. No problem, she sent pictures and the place looked clean and fine. So this review is about her other place on Seigel St in Brooklyn. 

The good: Rebecca is a friendly person and good at communicating with her guests. Booking, coordination and checking in and out went fine. We stayed in Rebecca's room in a shared loft space with 2-3 other girls. Her room was tidy and looked fine. 

The bad: Her place is one of those Brooklyn loft spaces which have been cheaply converted into shareable spaces. The bedrooms are basically made up of super thin dry wall construction with no windows (except small windows in the top). There is no sound isolation so you can hear everything. We woke up several times in the night when her room mates would come home drunk and re-heat food in the microwave. Even though they tried to stay quiet. You just hear everything. The rooms don't have any windows, except a few bizarre small windows in the roof into the living room and the other rooms. This mean, if any of the roommates turn on a light in their own room it will light up your room and keep you awake. 

The ugly: The place is a complete mess! There is trash everywhere and I have no idea when they cleaned the last time. There is a trashed ikea bed in the living room and beer bottles, plastic bags and trash piled up everywhere. 

I didn't rent the living room so in my opinion they can do what they want in their shared space. But you would have thought they would at least want to take out the trash or something when having AirBnb guests over. We were really disappointed by the state of the bathroom since it was a room we actually had to use; it was disgusting. We called Rebecca out in this when we checked in and she did a brief clean up the day afterwards. 

I am sorry for this negative review but I believe it is important to be honest towards the host and future guests. I would not recommend renting this place as it is not ideal for hosting guests and the people living there do not seem to make an effort to keep the place tidy and welcome for guests. Maybe you would like it if you are in the beginning of your 20s, looking for partying in New York and don't care about where you crash at night.",20
8887748,"The neighborhood was great. The apartment sat right on the corner of 5th Ave, which had a ton of cool little restaurants and thrift shops to explore. Target, Marshalls, Duane Read, and more all within walking distance.

The only point I would make is that the dining room/kitchen area was very messy, and the bathroom pretty messy as well. I really didn't use the kitchen area at all so it didn't really matter for my personally. Other than that, all was what was expected. The room itself was spotless, warm, and gets some nice light in the morning.

Overall, a great room to stay in for a short time.",50
8887748,"tl;dr DO NOT STAY HERE

My month long stay at Charlotte's place was the worst AirBnb experience I've EVER had. The location is great - you're right off of 5th avenue in Park Slope and within walking distance of Atlantic Terminal/Barclay's Center and the public transportation is excellent. I only have 500 words so I'll just cut to the chase about the bad parts of the experience:
 
1) The bathroom is disgusting. There is shed hair everywhere and I don't know if they ever clean it. I honestly feel bad for the 2 guys who live in the apartment because they have to deal with massive amounts of shed hair everywhere.

2) For the last 10 days of my stay, there was NO TOILET PAPER.

3) The building is undergoing repairs, so there were days were there was no water in the apartment (and thus the toilet couldn't even be flushed).

4) The entire apartment is d-i-r-t-y. From trash being left on the kitchen floor for days to the stove/fridge/cooking area never being cleaned. The room I stayed in was also very dirty. There was massive amounts of dust and shed hair everywhere in my room.

5) Kitchen appliances are kept on the floor. The microwave, water kettle, and toaster oven are all kept on the floor of the kitchen (which is where trash is also kept in-between garbage pickups).

6) As you can see from the picture, the room is tiny, but nobody emptied the closet/shoe rack so that I could store my things there during my month-long stay.

And finally, I left a few things in the refrigerator when I moved out, and texted Charlotte immediately when I realized and set up a time to come back and pick up my belongings 2 days later. When I arrived, they had already thrown away my belongings and so I wasted my time in going there. 

I was also accused of having somebody else living with me when I had a friend visiting for the weekend. It's pretty socially isolating living there too because the roommates speak to each other exclusively in Mandarin and so it was hard for me to connect. They're really nice people though!

All in all, I  did not enjoy my stay here and would never return.",50

Gemeinsame Räume wie Küche, Bad und Wohnzimmer waren eine Katastrophe (Stink, Hundehaaren, Waschbecken voll von Geschirr, Boden Wochenlang ungewascht).

However, we had many difficulties with this subway line, because at night it changes its schedules and it presents delays. There were days we have to get five different subways and spend three hours to get at the apartment. The apartment is on the top floor (4th floor) and the building has no elevator, so if you take a lot of bags, it will be difficult to get around. About the cleanness the score is zero. When we've arrived at the apartment there were two owner guests in another room and they left a very dirty and foul-smelling environment. This smell settled into our room and it was not gone. The bathroom was very dirty and the room we stayed in had signs of dirty that I believe have never been cleaned.

1. Although we didn't see Lior for both of the last 2 stays, Nissim was always there and communication with Lior was fast and they are both very responsive.
2. Checking in was simple because this apartment was across the hallway from the last apartment.
3. The internet is shared, which caused issues in the beginning, However, Nissim corrected the issue and even upgraded the speed almost immediately.
4. Apartment is relatively big.
The cons:
1. Bathroom is extremely small. It was very awkward to take showers.
2. Apartment very dusty, even after the cleaners cleaned, Nissim noticed the dust accumulated on the ceiling fan. We think there was dust mites too due to extreme allergies.
3. Couldn't open the front windows because of the amount of smoke from the rehab center/shelter next door, everyone smoked right by the window.
All in all, it's an ok apartment and if they do a better job cleaning it and no smoking next door, we would stay there again because the guys are super nice and helpful.",40

Second of all, the whole apartment was disgusting and unlivable! It was dirty all around, the bed had no blankets, the washroom was unbearable, and there was a layer of mold on the tub. My friend and I had to go out and buy cleaning equipment to disinfect and scrub their entire bathroom before even stepping foot in.

The process from TWC is smooth and there is no contract cost.

The location is great if you want a place near Times Square and close to all the locations. I was working at 3rd Avenue and 41st, it was a daily hour walk between 3rd and 10th but it allowed us to see all the great locations between the avenues.  

The ACs are old , each room has a large window AC with the living area having an AC as well. The elevator is a bit slow.  Grocery stores are next door so you can cook in the apartment",50
11018752,"I stayed in this apartment with a friend for a month.

In short: I don't believe this listing is at all appropriate for Airbnb. To my mind, staying in an Airbnb should be like staying in someone's home, even if it's a 'buy to rent' property. There should be a certain degree of welcoming atmosphere. There should be amenities provided. You should not have to go out and buy essentials on your arrival. 

This is a short-term sublet, not an Airbnb. There's a big difference.

Here's an inexhaustive list of what we had to buy for this place: cloths; dish soap; hand soap; sponges to wash dishes; trash bags; shampoo; shower gel; laundry detergent; cleaning spray... I could go on. It would probably be quicker to list what it DID have. There's no vacuum cleaner, only a plastic brush with no dustpan. 

Cons:
- The staff managing this property are rude, unfriendly, and incompetent. Firstly they were impossible to reach by email leading up to our stay. When we finally got in touch, they provided my friend with the wrong code for entering the building. She was stuck outside for 30 minutes wirth her luggage. Every time we interacted they were unfriendly and unwelcoming.
- ZERO amenities. Every Airbnb I've stayed at (and I've stayed at quite a few at this point) has AT LEAST provided hand soap, shampoo, and shower gel.
- Cheap and creaky furniture. The beds squeak like crazy.
- Incredibly hard mattresses. I'm talking IKEA's cheapest.
- There's only one bedside lamp in one of the rooms. 
- Cheap flooring and ugly decor. The couch is an eyesore.
- Soundproofing is non-existent; we could hear the neighbours' children clearly through the front door, as well as the elevator bell every time someone came down or up.
- The hot water went on and off randomly. Had to take several cold showers.
- The view is of an office building which doesn't ever turn its bright halogen lights off. Which leads me to...
- The cheap, flimsy, thin 'curtains', which did precisely nothing to fulfill their supposed function of blocking out either sunlight or the aforementioned halogen lights which stayed on all night. I had to wear a sleep mask to get any semblance of darkness.
- The washing machines downstairs are circa 1955. They do nothing. Soap left on clothes. We had to use the expensive laundromat 7 minutes' walk away.
- The wifi is HORRIFIC. It's unlocked (in 2016? Seriously?) and we could barely do anything with it; not even email. Be prepared to use your phone data allowance.
- The TV setup didn't work at all.
- Despite it being explicitly against Airbnb regulations, I was sent an invoice for gas & electricity a week after leaving. 
-  Tons of homeless people on this street.

Pros:
- Location, if your priority is being close to Time's Square.
- The delis across the road are passable.
- Hell's Kitchen has some good restaurants & bars.",50

I wanted to write about everything in details,but I'll be short ,as I think that there wouldn't be enough space,and it will take everyone much time to read.
I read the previous comments and I actually don't understand anyone.But keep in mind,I have stayed here mostly for 2 months and know every vice.

The area is not safe,very dirty,although the subway is close,you can hear it and it is not very frequent.
Actually,you text Tina but in fact you live with her father(who will be half naked)who wIll disturb you every 5 minutes when he doesn't like something,he will eavesdrop your conversations(as he did in my case and then asked to turn the phone off to talk with me) he will complain about everything that you do and don't,he will always mention what is included in price and what's not,and every day he will say what to do in the way HE only likes it to be done. 
( Tina lied,because she said that he would live near the house,but as you can see,he would actually live with you,from time to time there would be even her children and her brother).
Overall,I didn't like the house at all,it was dirty and uncomfortable to live in,I saw bugs in the bathroom and in the kitchen,there were not enough cooking supplies and (Website hidden by Airbnb) aware that your food in the fridge or shelves may be eaten.What's more,that ""old unconscious father""(politely saying) will not allow you to use even that minimum amount of facilities in the house,sometimes even water,and don't forget to minimize your usage of electricity,of course.
As you can understand,I haven't mentioned even the half of (Website hidden by Airbnb) so disappointed,I had an unpleasant experience living there which caused health problems,because I was constantly (Website hidden by Airbnb) was the worst house I have ever stayed in.

The listing also said there was a hot tub, and there wasn't. Most importantly, the top lock on the door was broken when I got there, and was never fixed during my one month stay.

When I asked the building's reception about this problem, they offered to send someone to my apartment to fix it. The issue was that the person who could fix it only works one day a week and that was not suitable with my schedule. They offered to send the person to my apartment when I was not there, which is something I would never allow. The price is over-exaggerated. The apartments are listed on the building's website for less than half the price. If you like this place and really feel like it is the place to stay at, go to (Website hidden by Airbnb) and book the apartment from there. You will pay a lot less.

DISCLAIMER: USA Stay was extremely responsive to my emails and phone calls. I truly respect the people working there. 

I lived in this apartment for 3 months. During my time, there have been a laundry list of issues with the apartment. In no way can I recommend this AirBnb to anybody else. 
1. Misrepresenting photos of the home. 
2. Over-priced even by Manhattan standards. 
3. Foul Odor. 
4. 9 Cockroaches-- I woke up at 7AM to on by my neck on my bed sheet. 
5. Water leakage.
6. Overall poor quality i.e. (Beds, Couch, TV, A/C units)

If the price per month was cheaper I would have less of an argument, but this place being $3,900 per month is laughable. If the photos in this Airbnb show Bed frames, mounted TV, shower curtain, or colored paint, you are looking at a dated photo. The photos they sold me on were misrepresentations of what the apartment was actually like.",50

13987276,"Note - I'm borrowing the account of my bf's mother to write this review

We've spent 4 nights at this place. It was on the 5th floor and the area is not that tourist-friendly but the house itself is actually nice. Yet, I'd have to say the manner of the host extremely upsets us. The husband was nice but the wife was unnecessarily rude. Not a single smile she gave from the very first encounter to the very last. Far from friendly. I'd say one nice thing she did was letting us check in super early - and that's pretty much it.
- We asked for 2 sets of keys when we arrived. She provided them to us but not without constant complaints
- She tried to kick us out before the actual checkout date. She strongly claimed her document said we must leave on 19th, luckily we had a confirmation email that said we were to leave on 20th. After I told her, she raised her eyebrow and frowned noticeably. Then she demanded that we leave early. She complained 'this is too much'. (We were barely home and not noisy at all. What exactly is too much?? And din't we agree on chechkout date in the first place?) You might say it could be a misunderstanding, but her manner showed it all throughout the period of our stay how much she wanted to kick us out.
- 2 rooms: one with ac and the other with a barely working fan. The room is unbearably hot for sleeping. When we talked to her, her answer was 'You get a very cheap price.' So...? We were not staying for free in case you forgot. Cheap or not, you're supposed to let us know beforehand - showing honesty.
- The bathroom! I'm not sure if it's totally normal in NYC but opening a bathroom door even though you know perfectly well there's someone in it is extremely unacceptable to us. My bf's sister was having a shower when she, out of nowhere, just opened the door and walked in.
- She came and knocked the bathroom door loudly every morning - waking us up. The bathroom is right next to the bedrooms. And it didn't happen only once in each day... 
- When we asked how to open the apartment door, instead of teaching us, she gave us an annoying glance and just said it's easy. That's it. Not teaching us how to at all

I'm sorry to say this is the worst airbnb experience so far. I'm honest though. We did not expect 5-stars service but kindness and friendliness would be appreciated rather than a constant frown and ceaseless complaints.",20
13993046,This was my first bad airbnb experience.  Juan let one of us sleep on the floor for half the stay and ignored our messages. Room was extremely noisy due to the highway and construction work. The bathroom was full of cockroaches but without toilet paper. Wouldn't recommend.,40

-the floor was covered with dust and dustbunnies, thanks also to a decaying carpet

First and foremost, this is a STUDIO not a 1-Bedroom as advertised.  I wish I could say that the issues end there, but they don’t.  There seem to be multiple units available in the building because the views and furniture are not the same as the post.  Laundry is on each floor (you have to pay) and not in the unit as stated.  When asked about it, we were told even after we emailed specifically about and confirmed that the laundry was in the unit, it’s not.  The machines require a card, which is not provided.  The one in the unit is for the old company not the new.  We asked for a new one and the response we received was to go the doorman.  The doorman told us we needed to purchase on the 13th floor. There is no parking on-site as stated.  The cheapest one is down the street and will run you about $580 for the month.  There is no pool as claimed, though we really didn’t care about this feature, but those of you looking may.  When we first arrived, there wasn’t any toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap, garbage bags, or even a shower curtain.  After traveling all day some of these things were rather important to do as soon as you walk in the door.  The bed is extremely uncomfortable.  You can feel every spring in your back that we went and purchased a cheap mattress topper. Raymond was very responsive, but after being told see the doorman for everything we decided it wasn’t worth our time and we were already out the money anyway.  Again, I wish the issues stopped there.  The leasing offices uses this apartment as a showing unit.  This is not the unit I would want to use to showcase my “luxury” building as the unit is in serious need of a paint job and cleaning.  We were only notified once that they were coming to show, but all the others they just show up.  We were here on business and mostly work from home, so we were here a lot during the day.  It’s annoying and illegal in NYC to show up unannounced and the leasing agents act like you’re an inconvenience that you aren’t happy your there.  We also discovered they had come in while we were out without our knowledge.  I’d usually put my electronics or valuables away if I knew they were coming.  The only positive review I can give about this place is that the doormen, well all but one, are very nice and personable.",40

19244237,"We found the apartment very dirty, with no effort made to even put things away. We felt a bit gross walking barefoot in the bathroom and the sitting area was not usable as there were piles of stuff on the couch etc. I'm guessing this is a shared place with several roommates, but we had no idea who else was staying or if the other bedrooms were Airbnb guests as we never met anyone and just came and went with a door lock key by ourselves. This didn't make us feel secure about leaving any of our stuff, so we just left in the morning and toting suitcases around to breakfast. It also doesn't seem reasonable to leave a pet cat without the owner being there...we have cats and are very used to them, but I didn't expect to be left with someone else's pet. Although he was very sweet, he woke us up all night wanting to come in and out of the room as his owner wasn't around. This felt more like borrowing a key to an empty frat house than an Airbnb.",40
19390314,"Honestly dealing with Gillian was the worst experience I've ever had. First of all I got scammed out of 200 dollars on top of the 6k I paid. After I booked I was told I needed to get a bank check of 1500 dollars as a deposit on a electric bill. I finally talked to her down to 200 because she told me she would simply just take out the AC. Was also told that fans were being installed and only crappy fan bought from target was there in the apartment. Either way it's been ten days and I've yet to hear from her and I was supposed toget the bill and the remainder of my money back. The very second I walked into the apartment it had a HORRIBLE stench. It smelt like death and moth balls. Both were found in the apartment, dead mice and moth balls! Also the wifi password that was posted on the fridge was wrong!! There was dog hair everywhere!! Disgusting. It was on the bed I was supposed to sleep on, on all the towels, dirty hair on the bars of soap in the bathroom! I really disliked Gillian as a host as she was not accommodating at all and even asked for me to apologize to her after all this! the only good thing about this was place was the location! Also everything in the place is outdated. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER DEALS OUT THERE! DONT GO THROUGH GILLIAN HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! MY WORST AIRBNB EXPERIENCE HANDS DOWN",20
19531174,"Most horrible Airbnb experience I ever had, we had to call Airbnb customer service and move to an other place.
Ian was abroad so he told us that his roommate James would welcome us.
We first had to ask for the address of the apartment (not written on Airbnb) and then for the roommate phone number.
He never answered to our next messages about dropping our luggage and our check-in.
So for our check-in we had to see with the roommate, we asked for dropping our luggage in the morning, he told us to come when we want in the morning and to keep calling him until he wakes up. He never answered, we arrived at 9 am and he answered at 2 am... so we began by loosing half a day of our trip.
Then, we did the check-in and James offered us beers.
We saw that the bathroom was dirty, especially the floor and the closets and that there were a smell of cold tobacco in the apartment. There were also mess in the living room and on the worktop in the kitchen.
It became a nightmare when we came back in the evening. The bedspread had holes, there were no quilt/duvet cover, the duvet was torn, the fitted sheet was dirty, as well as the pillowcases. There were dirt stains on the towels.
In brief, not a correct bed at all, not descent.
We reached the climax when my friend found a porn magazine under the table in the living room and when James came back, just after these findings, totally DRUNK.
It was late so we tried to sleep a little bit here and the next morning I called the Airbnb customer service, we've been refunded and we moved to an other place.",20

20588184,Morgan is a very hospitable and accommodating host. He lives in a one-bedroom walk-up which is exactly what you would expect in New York. It is very nicely decorated he takes every consideration to make sure that you are comfortable. He is close to public transit and the Yankee Stadium. He is knowledgeable about the city so he gives great advice. He even offers refreshments lovely person great personality. I booked this home because it was close to an event that my cousin was throwing. And he gave me directions he made sure that I knew exactly where I was going. He was waiting when I got back we set up part of the night and had a great conversation.,50

Spend extra, go some place else.",50
20688793,"We had problems from the beginning. There was no key ready for us at checkin. The apartment had lights out in the hallway and one lamp had no bulbs. The dining table legs weren’t even connected to the table top so the top was simply balanced on the legs and would fall apart when moved. The tv and internet didn’t work for three weeks and after checkin they tried to insist on a $4,000 security deposit that was never previously mentioned. would NEVER stay here again.",20
20811696,"Where to begin with this property—this was the single worst experience we’ve ever had in an AirBnB or other similar short-term rental. First, the advertisement is nearly a complete fabrication. A couple examples: there is no garage associated with the building as advertised. (There is a garage a block away for $50ish a night.) While there is a fitness center in the building, no access is available for AirBnB guests. Other issues like the lack of a fireplace in the unit are certainly not a big deal, but do serve to highlight how disreputable the owners of this AirBnB are in the advertising of the property. Smaller amenities listed that didn't actually exist in the unit are too many to make a full accounting. Eventually, curiosity got the better of us, and we figured out the pictures used to advertise the place were ripped from the last time the apartment was listed for sale on Zillow years ago. The current condition is nothing like the images presented, and the furniture in the unit looks/acts like something out of a nightmare swap meet. (Example: the couch started actively shedding its “leather” like a pet dog with mange after just a few weeks of normal wear/tear). 

Upon arrival, we picked up a dozen dead cockroaches from the floor. Additionally, the pillows and linens were so soiled from a previous occupant, the stains looked like old, Civil War bandages. We got quite a laugh at the  plastic bags stuffed in the windows to keep the rain/weather out of the apartment. Less funny was the mold growing where this ""fix"" didn't work as planned (shocking, I know). The coffee maker was so dirty that, once the owner finally acknowledged there might possibly be significant issues, rather than trying to clean the old machine, he simply purchased an entirely new coffee maker and threw the old “science experiment” away. Multiple light bulbs were burned out upon arrival and it fell on us to replace them or brush our teeth by iPhone flashlight. There was no internet or cable and it took almost a week to address this. The air conditioning in the bedroom was completely inoperative and despite three separate attempts to get this fixed, the owner became aggravated and stopped taking our calls or even attempting to address further issues. (As an aside, the situation almost became dangerous when a heat wave arrived and 100+ degree temperatures inundated the city. The only way the apartment remained livable was by creating a Rube Goldberg-esque series of fans to flow the single operating air conditioner's airflow throughout the unit.) Is there a queen bed? Yes. Can two people actually sleep on it? No--the symphony of squeaks and squawks you'll be privy to every time your partner shifts their weight in the night can only be compared to an elementary school band ""tuning"" their instruments. 

Ultimately, we wish we could attach photos of this place just so others can share in our laughter at how comically terrible the conditions were. Why did we stay? We're young, dumb, thought we could ""gut it out"", and had pressing professional responsibilities that took up 12+ hours a day leaving us without the bandwidth to move to a new place. In retrospect, we should have “sucked it up” in the beginning and left these scam artists with their apartment. That said, after significant dialogue with AirBnB arbitration, the owner admitted fault and reduced our rent $650—not nearly enough in our opinion but we were in a classic rock/hard place scenario. Lesson learned: never rent an apartment on AirBnB that isn’t adequately reviewed.",20
20815900,Very irresponsible host.He canceled our reservation at check in time.He ignored my calls.Because of him me and my friend spent 6 hours talking to Airbnb agent on the phone in the street trying to find a new place.And fortunately we found a place to stay at 9:00pm.Thank you Marlon for ruining our vacation .,20

21312191,"The hotel entrance was nice, everything was kept clean in the lobby. But upon arriving to the room there was a musty, smoky smell. The sheets looked as if they did not change them.

Customer service was good",20

Bathroom was ALWAYS dirty with pee on the toilet seat despite me leaving a note in it. It was horrible, I had to look for another place on such a short notice, I had to drag my heavy bags looking for another place. Never again.

Also the information they provided for check-in was wildly inaccurate and I wandered around the property for almost an hour before finally getting in. Oh also for how much they promote how well they treat their maid (living wage and all) they still called her in after she had gone home for the day already and made her come back just to sweep up the floor in my room. It was a shit show- honestly though the bed was comfy and the 6 train was super close, so I didn't hate it. I just want all of you to know what you're getting into because they did a snazzy job of marketing and portraying themselves on the listing and that's not what y'all getting.",20

21817961,"Adrianne's place is a cute, small, typical NY apartment and you couldn't ask for a better location if you wanna stay in Harlem. You can get midtown or downtown on the 3 train in a giffy if you need too. Was also cheap by NY standards (which is still expensive, of course). But there was no heat in December and I froze my @$$ off.  To clarify, I'm not saying it wasn't heated to my liking, I'm saying there was zero heat. In December. I contacted Adrianne and the superintendent repeatedly but nothing changed while I was here. I know this is not Adrianne's fault, I'm sure it's a case of an old building and a negligent landlord, but point is when you pay what you pay for a airbnb in NY you shouldn't be sleeping while shovering in a tracksuit and a toque, or unable to work on your labtop cause your hands are so cold.  Secondly, the person Adrianne hired to clean the place between my arrival and the previous guests departure did a really half-ass job. Didn't even touch the bathroom, I know cause the trashbin was full and the bathtub had visible grime and hair. Germaphobe's nightmare. Again, I know this wasn't Adrianne's fault, just being honest about my experience.  Other things to keep in mind is that there is no closet space or coathangers and the oven has been converted to storage (there is a toaster however). If Adrianne could ensure her unit was heated in the winter and hire a cleaner who actually cleaned it would be a great spot.",40

As this was a last-minute booking over a busy holiday period, and affordable, it served it's purpose just fine.  I didn't find any clean towels, so ended up buying a cheap one from a 99cent store.  The place is a basic old NY apartment.  It could have used more attention to cleaning (the floor was dirty and I even found old nuts along with dirt on the floor in the bedroom - the toilet wasn't clean but the shower was fine).  The bed sheets seemed a bit worn, but again, for the price, it served it's purpose which was to provide a place to crash for a couple of nights during a very busy time.  It had heat, a bed, and hot water.",50

22366842,"The people working for Outpost are great, they have a genuine desire to make Outpost guest feel welcome and part of a community. Still, co-living is a very particular living situation and you must be sure of what you are getting into - those ""shared spaces"" are never not crowded, people will be hanging out a little later and a little louder than you might like, cleaning rules will not always be followed, etc. It's what you sign up for and if you find this tolerable for a short-term stay there shouldn't be problems. That said, Outpost is more akin to  a hostel and the cost is very steep for what you get - even for NYC. My advice is to look elsewhere first, and if you do decide on Outpost go directly to their website as it costs more to go through third parties like Airbnb. Yes,  it was very uncomfortable to find out everyone was paying different amounts for the same living situation.",40

24130728,"Positives:  You can expect to see exactly what the pictures look like!  Great view, you can walk to almost everywhere.  It's a good location and the building is nice, esp if you want a pool and gym area. Train is a few blocks away, uber picks you up across the street.  Negatives:  You have to live out of your suitcase because there is not any room in the closet and there is not any dresser for you to use.  This is actually Matt's apartment he is renting out and it is jammed packed with all their belongings.  Very uncomfortable and creepy.  There was not any ""private"" area for guests in this whole place- if it were a 2 bedroom then at least you'd have some privacy. There is pet hair everywhere - we did not have wi-fi the whole time we were there - we were told to say we were friends while checking in, and don't say anything about airbnb because they don't like it.   This was told to us when we went to check in.  Really?  I think this is prohibited in this complex.  We were supplied 1 towel each for 5 days.  The bathroom didn't even have a hand towel to use and forget about face towels, they don't exist - Matt told me he doesn't use them so I guess he figured nobody else does either!   So, if you book Matt's apartment,  just know your moving literally into HIS home - there is no room for you to unpack your own things.  This was uncomfortable for us.  We traveled many times using airbnb and (Hidden by Airbnb) with no issues - this place has issues I'm sorry to say.",40
24289926,"This is a safe, great location rental that has the essentials you need for a NY getaway. Beware there are stairs- sometimes even up from the subway due to construction, and a few steps down from the street to the entry, and from the entry to the apartment is a 3-story walk-up. No challenge if you are fit, but consider how and what you will carry up with you. The subway is very close (1/2 block) with multiple lines to conveniently get around Manhattan from midtown east. The kitchen has all the basics to make a quick meal if you want to save money in the big city, or heat up leftovers. The bathroom was spotless and had a heated floor which was a nice surprise on a chilly morning. Bed was comfortable. We would stay again.",50
24289926,"The original description indicated that the room included a private bathroom. This was not the case. The room did not have any bathroom connected to it. The only available bathrooms were out in the hallway and were shared among all the occupants of the apartment. This was a huge problem because my GF required a private bathroom and we chose this listing over others just because of the ‘private bathroom’ claim. In addition, the room wasn't exactly quiet enough. There was a lot of noise from the other occupants and from upstairs. The biggest issue was that the host refused to address any of these problems and ignored my messages. The room wasn't acceptable for us so we messaged the host and requested to check out early in order to stay at a different location. There was absolutely zero response from the host. Instead, all he did was switch the ‘private bathroom' to 'shared bathroom' in the listing description. I had to call Airbnb directly to explain the situation and they were able to cancel the reservation. Beware this host, for he is untrustworthy and simply doesn’t care.",50

We had to constantly clean up the water on the floor and then later used a bowl to collect the dripping water which we had to dump out. I guess if you dont need the AC then it shouldn't be a problem. Also the floors were a little beat up in the bedroom. If your looking for a budget friendly basic  spot then this place will be fine.

25032434,"DO NOT stay with Brian!
Brian ruined our first day in New York.
We booked with Brian because his place was cheap and looked clean, and it wasn’t too far from downtown. 
Despite having no reviews, we took a chance because, as my wife said, the system relies on people with no reviews being given a chance. We feel hugely let down and unfortunately we feel we will be far more cautious in the future.
We arrived in Manhattan at 2.30pm and walked - each carrying around 30kg of baggage as we are ending a four-month trip around the world - a mile to the nearest metro station. We got on a packed train with all this bagage and needed an Uber from the station to get to his house.
Upon arriving at his house, we found no signs of anyone home. We sat on his front porch for around an hour while calling, texting and messaging him on AirBnB, until a severe thunderstorm hit and we (and all our baggage) were soaked and we were forced to call another Uber to a nearby bar to weigh up our options.
I tried calling and messaging Brian again and again (8 times in fact) to no avail. All this while we searched for accommodation for a relatively reasonable price - we ended up paying 150% more than what we paid Brian for our abortive booking because it was so late. We were in fact turned down twice and thank God we eventually found a lovely lady in Brooklyn who we had to beg to let us stay the first night and who stayed up until gone 1am preparing the room despite having to get up for work at 6am.
We then walked a mile to the subway and boarded the metro before getting another Uber to her place. I estimate that this additional travel cost us an extra $50 - money we did not have to waste.
When I finally managed to speak to Brian on the 9th attempt, he was initially apologetic but this soon turned into a denial that the booking was ever confirmed. He told me the room was occupied and therefore we couldn’t stay, despite us having paid him already. He was in complete denial about the payment having been made, and when I challenged him on it, his words were to the effect of: “I’ll have to call you back as I’m in work”. When I insisted that he cancel the booking from his end so I received a full refund, he agreed. Still, 6 hours later, he hadn’t 
 cancelled it.
I lodged my complaint with AirBnB. In fairness to AirBnB they dealt with it very well - they issued a full refund and compensated us.",20

I waited for almost an hour outside her house, kept on calling her and got NOTHING, nada,no answer. Finally, I called Airbnb and told them my situation and they also tried reaching her, they got the same silent treatment. Several hours later Ms Dee sent me a message saying that she was sorry that she’s at work, very unprofessional. So Airbnb gave me a full refund. Airbnb needs to get rid of her and her bad business skills. It’s not fair for any guests to be left out this way. I don’t wish this experience to anybody. My suggestion to everyone is to please stay away from her, she’s definitely cold hearted, disorganized, and don’t have a clue of what she’s doing.",20
26272421,Not bad for what you pay for! It’s hard to find a affordable full apartment in the city,50
26272421,"Oh god, how to even begin. The worse AirBnB experience in my life. The only thing this place has going for it is it’s location. 

Facts:
Pros: location (10-15 min to the subway and can transfer you anywhere in the city). There is a new TV that gives you access to Netflix and YouTube TV

Cons: the place was obviously not clean, he claimed it was cleaned but there was trash in the garbage bin, the sheets and sofa smelt like sweat. I had to take the linens to a cleaner so I wouldn’t have to suffer the smell. I bought cleaning supplies to wipe down everything I used because the place had hair and dust everywhere. Each time I opened or closed a door,  dust particles that are bundled around old hair would fly around. The kitchen drawers have dead ants and again dust everywhere. The place looked like Corey had spent the night and forgot a guest was coming, quickly threw out whatever obvious trash he had and left. The bed was left with pillows to one side and the blanket shifted to one side. Upon unraveling the blanket you are greeted with a few big dark stains in the bed sheet. Oh and behind the sofa there’s a random bed sheet and pillows just tucked away in case (probably one of his frat buddies) someone wants to stay the night in the sofa. The mattress is from Casper and is a foam mattress that sits on a frame that is too small for it. The edges dip down towards the floor and if you shift a little the bed will most likely wake your partner from the noise.

The fridge is fairly new and has some stains but isn’t too bad. The kitchen is unbearable apart from that.

The bathroom is disgusting. The sink was filled with hair as if Corey just got done shaving and headed out for the day. I had to wipe down everything once again. The shower and toilet was the usual nyc standard (old but worked and was fine). 

The building is old and they have central heating that you have no control over. It’s generally hot and you need to keep the window cracked open, even in the winter and over night so you don’t sleep in sweat. 

There are constantly people coming to the building and the way the buzzer is set up, everyone calls this apartment no matter what so get ready to be harassed by strangers.

Verdict:

Why would anyone want to stay here? Well, take this review as the brutal truth. I wanted to spend the holidays with my wife in the city. There is a lot of value in this apartment for where it is located but it doesn’t justify the lack of cleanliness and attention to detail from Corey the host. It was a disaster running around to just make the place livable. The reason why we didn’t move to another place was because Corey was unwilling to refund the stay and he still owes me $100 for the cleaning, which he hasn’t sent. I complained to AirBnB and filed a case and I’ve sent them several pictures of the condition and approved that it was dirty. I will never be staying here again. If you decide to, please take this review as a warning.",50
26297906,"Pros: 3 Minutes away from the train station!!! 60 minutes to central park. Edith is a great woman. Very thoughtful, easy to check in, will try to  accommodate your every need. You get quite a large room (as seen in the pictures), without much street noise (in comparison to other parts of NYC). You share the house with other residents, some of which I've met and had some great conversations with. Also, you get to live in an interesting part of Brooklyn and explore hassidic jewish culture. 
Cons: The house is old. Many parts of it are worn down and not well maintained. Because you share the common areas, cleanliness isn't always assured. The bottom floor is renovated, so it is nicer than the second floor (in which the room is). You have full access to all the floors, so you can just use the bathroom and kitchen in the first floor. The house is a bit cluttered, but smells nice. 
Overall: Definitely worth the experience.",50
26297906,"Run - Run - Run ......Edith goes on adnausea.  You just want to check in & get about your NYC experience.  She sucks the life outta ya!  She comes across as friendly concern but it's actually her being nosey 

The place is filthy & screams for a DEEP cleaning!  Bathrooms are disgusting  - pubic hair all over toilets.  Edith's cleaning fees are exhorbanant - $95 -  & she cleans NOTHING.  I suggest you do not stay here just find another place - I did!",50

27527506,"Just a horrible place for long stays.  pans and pots were so rusty I couldn't cook anything. I was even scared to boil water. 

The bathroom was never cleaned until asked. 

The kitchen had one spoon and one fork for 8 rooms. Is that really good for long stays?
 
No cutlery at all to cook or do anything. By the ending of it it I was boiling water for 2 min ramen in a cup in microwave.
 
There was no butter knife to even put peanut butter on my bread. 

There was no toaster so I can toast. 

Just terrible and horrible experience.  

I wish airbnb itself would something about it. 

The nail.in coffin was my lightbulb went out in my room I asked them to change it, they asked me to get new one rather than changing it themselves. Are you freaking kidding me? 

Momoyo never replied to me at all. I had to send 2-3 messages for her to reply.  She always put it to her assistant  on the property. He never cleaned until asked. 

The shower curtain is so freaking dirty I didnt want to go in the shower. bare feet.  

Ultimately I had to reach to airbnb support team. 

Momoyo and hiroki both run lot of properties together. I'm not sure if it's worth it.",50

El anfitrión nos dijo que había problemas de agua, y eso no fue así, al llegar nos encontramos medio apartamento cerrado, no teníamos ni cocina ni secador de pelo. Cerro medio apartamento porque entraron unos nuevos inquilinos que hablaban muy fuerte, ponían música muy alta y no respetaban nada a los demás.  Todo un desastre.

I have stayed my first day cleaning the bathroom which was in bad condition made me threw up.
the kitchen tools and kitchen were oily covered by dust!! 
The linens with stains and pillows with bad smell, also she is working as a hair artist so no wondering how the place is covered by falling hair. 
There is no any real privacy in the place as the apartment is located in ground floor with a neighbors stand still in front of the place door.
Unfort. I had not much time in NYC to make a complaint and move to another place, especially we arrived after long trip and wanted to have rest thats why we stayed. After that I receive now a fake complaint from the place owner asking for over $150 as a compensation, as I left the apartment in bad condition !!!

28488070,"The apartment is located in Bushwick which will probably be the next trend district in the middle of Brooklyn. The apartment has very good subway connections to Manhattan through the J-Line (Kosciuszko St - 4min walk) and the M-Line (Central Av - 6min walk). The apartment is on the 3rd floor, which we liked, and the neighbors are very friendly. Especially Javier, who takes care of the apartment on behalf of the Airbnb host, is an awesome person.

The host himself, Michael, is also really kind. We never met him in person, but he always replied fast and was always helpful when anything was needed.

What's not really clear in the description is that there're 3 bedrooms, but one is a walk-through room and the other two are two stories in a single room (maisonette style). So there's no real separation / privacy. However, when we needed some more space, Michael also helped us out with that!

The price, even though it's high, is reasonable for a Bushwick apartment. The beds  in the apartment were new, quite big and really comfy. The couch, TV, fridge and stove/oven were also pretty new. When we arrived, the apartment was fairly clean and had fresh sheets and towels.

On the other hand, the bathroom seemed used and wasn't really clean, so we went over it before we used it. Also, it smelled like gas in the apartment, even though Javier came to check for a leak which apparently didn't exist. Probably in the meantime they fixed this ;-).

In total, we really enjoyed our stay (about 2 months). You shouldn't expect a five-star Airbnb but you can have a really good time there if you are not too picky. We would definitely come back.",50

There is mold in the basement, which has a history of flooding problems, which I learned from several of the previous guests. When you reach out to stoop, they are quick to place blame on you or other guests when there’s a problem in the apartment. And there will be problems.

The heater blew out smoke, shower had yellow stains and was completely broken, windows weren’t fit to the wall so breeze was coming in(windows had no locks), there were footprints on the walls and gross stains absolutely everywhere, the linens were dirty, I can’t believe this place is available to rent. Upon reading the reviews they are all completely different and speaking of skyline views and rooms-they seem fake. I ended up canceling my one month reservation.

30585165,"Bathroom and Kitchen are completely different than the images posted in the listing. The bathroom was absolutely filthy. It smelled really bad 90% of the time. There is a girl that lives on a lease at the stay who leaves balls of hair in the shower drain so the water will come up to your ankles and theres hair floating everywhere. Some days I would go without a shower or I would use the bathroom elsewhere. This was especially after coming into the bathroom to find toilet paper soiled with PERIOD BLOOD on THE FLOOR. The smell of the blood was foul as well because she wouldn't dispose of those sanitary products adequately, leaving them exposed in the trash bin. I had to always clean up and wipe down after her because she would also NEVER WASH HER HANDS and proceed to touch EVERYTHING. Also this listing stated two shared baths but there is only 1. The kitchen was just gross I would never go in there. The bedroom was just dusty and it is a VERY VERY VERY tight space. Understand that the bed and the door nearly touch.

The photos of the bathroom and kitchen in the listing were completely different from where I was staying. I spent a lot of money on buying additional data from my cellular provider because the ""wifi"" offered at this stay is incredibly inadequate. I was not staying at the address that was provided by Airbnb. It was very noisy. The host was rude. I was not informed there was going to be a racist living downstairs which made it very difficult as a WOC.

The host is responsive but is quite rude. They didn't even introduce themselves when we met (days after I checked in) I had to ask them who they were and how they got access to the stay. When I complained to them about the girl downstairs making racist, offensive, derogatory comments about myself and other POC at the stay, the host brushed it off and told me not to make it a big deal because she was on a lease. When I complained to the host about the WIFI not reaching the room I was in they insisted that it still worked and that I ""need to get unlimited data from your phone."" I told them I couldn't even get work done on the WIFI connection and they texted me back saying ""my room is for sleep not for business"" and ""my wifi is for residential."" My work is done on social media, so if you can't even scroll on (Hidden by Airbnb) or send a (Hidden by Airbnb) on the WIFI then the WIFI is not even good for ""residential use."" The host came knocking at my door insisting that Youtube works on THEIR DEVICE. It was exhausting having to explain and prove to the host, who doesn't stay in the same place as myself and other AirBnb guests at the stay, that their WIFI doesn't work and was costing myself and other's some serious money. I also witnessed this host lash out at another pair of guests who were staying in the room next to mine who simply complained about the girl downstairs being uncleanly. The host called them a headache and cancelled their reservation leaving them vulnerable and with nowhere to go. I was too scared to want to contact the host about any issues after that after seeing how they reacted to such a simple request from other guests. I only asked her about mail.

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I was quite close to subway stations, making it easy to travel. However, the location is not even the one provided to airbnb, it was so unclean and very noisy.

This room in this stay is way too overpriced, especially considering how much I spent on providing the amenities, that were supposed to be present, for myself. Also, it's absurd to be charging a cleaning fee that is very clearly not being put to use.",47
30637957,"The apartment is not what they sell you. Only two positive things about it: Doorman (Joel) and Location. 
The rest is pure fake advertisement. The furniture looks new, but it is really old. It’s owned by a company, so basically you do not know whom you are renting from. We requested a bunch of things to be fixed and we got with the surprise that one day (without us being there or aware) someone got into the apartment to “fix” the problem. Thank God I had a camera for my dog and we recorded everything. The hosts response to that was that it was something normal to happen. We had to solve the issue directly with Airbnb and they were able to compensate for the unsafe situation. Can’t give you guys a review about a host that I don’t even know who they are, but I would expect something way better from a listing that is “premium” it’s not the “premium” they are selling. Don’t overpay for something that you can get for a cheaper price. The AC doesn’t work, the ayer doesn’t run in the shower and the host is unresponsive and we don’t know who the host is.

30929071,"DO NOT STAY HERE IT IS A SCAM I have been using Airbnb for over five years and never had an experience as horrible as I had here. Upon arriving to the building we were locked out for two hours attempting to open the apartment with the keys provided in the lock box. It was the right key for sure but the door itself would not open, we had multiple people attempt to open the door with the same keys thinking we must be doing it wrong somehow. Host was completely unresponsive. We had no choice but to call a locksmith after two hours attempting to get the door open. Turns out the lock was completely broken and the locksmith company had told us multiple times in their professional opinions there was absolutely no way for us to get in without having changed the locks completely. We did not want to do this because it was not our home but we payed over 500 dollars for a three day stay and had no other choice. It was 400 dollars out of pocket, we informed the host of the issue in great detail the entire time, and had no response until four days later after our stay that we were not to be refunded and would be charged another locksmith fee she was charged claiming to have been locked out of her own apartment even though we left her the new keys and informed her of exactly what had happened to us. We were spoken to very rudely, she was completely unsympathetic of the issue and threatened to charge us more money. To this day we have not been contacted by the host after multiple attempts to sort the situation out. 

Lock issue aside this place is not worth nearly the amount that is being charged. The entire building is completely noisy at every hour of day and night. The hallways had cat feces on every level. Trash in the hallways as well and residents smoking cigarettes on stairwells constantly. Inside the apartment the cat box (right next to the kitchen) had not been cleaned in what looked like weeks, i felt so sorry for the sweet cat. Anytime he would use his box the entire apartment would smell of cat pee and poop. The beds were very uncomfortable and there is no fan or privacy when using the bathroom or shower due to the apartment being very small in itself. We had payed for a two bedroom apartment but this place is completely unsuitable for more than one or two people. With all the stress and money spent over the course of our stay you might as well pay for a hotel room or rent a single room on Airbnb. Nothing about this place was worth one cent or one minute of our time, all we did was leave with a horrible experience having lost 400 dollars to fix this girls broken door, and to be threatened days later to have more of our money taken from us.",20

32312837,"The only good about this place is location. A woman who lives there likes to watch TV shows by late nights up to 1-2am, or start doing something in the livingroom. Floors in the appartments is very old so every step anybody make inside the appartments or above you will hear squeek. I saw a mouse inside this appartments that ran in my room and one day a cockroach, I let the host know about it. But her mother (woman who is home 24/7) came and started telling me that a saw a fly. Then we had an argument and I was so mad that I used an ""f"" word pointing at rotten bananas in the kitchen that you will find in the kitchen anytime and mess in the appartments. Bags are everywhere. The place is not suitable for cooking. One thing is good is proximity to metro. So if you staying for one or couples of night it's ok, but in my case it was one month and it was terrible. And as a bonus suddenly I got charged by Airbnb at the end of my stay for one more night when I paid everything in full and for one night in cash.

Air conditioning did not work, they offered me another apartment in the same hotel which was exactly the same.

32678724,"Gross gross gross! First off I thought the reviews that I read about an unusual smell were just dramatic but it is the first thing you notice as soon as you walk in the lobby downstairs. Truthfully it smells like cat poop and it smells like cat poop all throughout the lobby to the elevators and each day we stayed there.  I’m thinking it’s just what it smells like which is pretty awful. I didn’t smell that smell in any other buildings we went into in New York so it must be Row NYC.  Next the rooms are VERY tiny and leave you little room to unpack and move around especially if you have more than two people.  We are a family of four with a three-year-old and an 11-year-old. Here is the reason we will never return to Row NYC.  The cleanliness of this room was repulsive. The phone had dirt and smudges all over the number pad  and look like they have never been cleaned off. Second the sheet had random stains as well as the comforter and under sheet. It also had hairs on it.  The worst was the bathtub. It had what looked like black mold growing in the corner and there were stains all over the bottom of the tub. Neither one of my children took baths while we were staying at this hotel because I didn’t feel comfortable with how gross the tub looked.  Yes the location is great but there are other hotels that offer a great location and have clean rooms. I have stayed in many Airbnb’s and this, by far, was the worst one. Theres a reason it’s a cheap place to stay.",40

32876011,"My boyfriend and I booked this very last minute accommodation. There was a UN meeting in NY and hotels rates were well over $300 per night for even a Days Inn, so we found this new listing for about $85/night and hoped for the best. Quite frankly, the price was the only thing that kept me staying at this place for 6 nights.
Cleanliness was our biggest issue during our stay here. Kitchen sink was filled with dirty dishes up to the faucet upon arrival and continued to pile more from the roommate throughout the week and was never washed. Kitchen and bathroom trash bins both stuffed full upon (Website hidden by Airbnb) we collected our own trash and recycle in paper bags and disposed them ourselves. Pictures looked cleaner than reality. If you imagine that, the rest wasn't clean either, couch has tons of stains, I would advise wearing flops indoors, things got stuck to our feet. I do believe the bed sheets /towels were washed, they smelled clean, although there was a red stain (lipstick?) and the material seemed to accumulate dust and things. We had a total of 6-7 bites and woke up itching the first night, caught a mosquito in the room which we believe to be the culprit and cut my foot in the process of catching.
Second issue, when we arrived to the apartment, her roommate was surprised and told us she was not expecting guests (I think we may also be Shai's first aribnb guests). The roommate was easy going, but she was returning around 3-4 AM at night and cooking or watching something which woke us up. Shai showed up briefly on the second day, we weren't expecting to see her--through previous messaging I was only informed we would be sharing the space with the roommate.

32876011,"It was the worst experience ever. The host wasn't there so her friend let us check-in. It was fine but we didn't get any information about the house. And the worse thing is her flatmate. When we made a reservation, the host said she's rarely at home. But from the first day she brought her friends. Even in the first day, they had a party until late at night. They didn't care about us at all and there's no soundproof so we couldn't sleep after 8 hours flight even they made fun of us. And we've check the rule and it said ""no party/event"". Is this only for guests? I understand it is her house as well but there was not respect for the guest at all. About the cleanliness, it was terrible. I have no idea that was the just way they live but after party they didn't clean up for 3 days so we couldn't use the kitchen even the sink and it was stinky. The bathroom was also dirty, there was a chunk of hair on the bath tub and floor. The bin was full and it didn't empty during our stay. Also we found cockroach in the bathroom. The location was good but except that there's no reason to pay this amount of money and this room shouldn't be posted.",30

BAD :

-if you want air conditional you have to pay 100$.
- very DARTY, the girl who is in charge of cleaning don’t do it well. At the chek in it was darty. (Hair on the floor, paper under my bed, impossible to open window without have mold on my hands...) 
After she never wash the floor (I stayed 1 month), she just sweep it. The kitchen is use by 8 person so it is often darty. The girl just wash sink 1 a week.
- bad reactivity of the host. It’s a kind of society who is in charge of the airbnb I think so you just can talk to him by the apps. I told him that it was darty and he don’t wash the floor. He took 2 weeks to change a very darty shower curtain. He doesn’t want to give kitchen dust so I can’t dry my dishes. He gave a bath mat after I ask.
After 2 weeks I send him another message and he answer me that it was my fault and I have to wash the floor... even if 8 persons use the kitchen...
- there are just 1 glass or plate so you can’t eat at the same time that the other roommate. 
- there is no storage unit in the bedroom 
- the bin are just in front of the window and there are raccoon which make noise when they try to eat it.


It’s a bad  place but that need more maintenance and I think the host need to be more responsif.

34946870,Horrible experience.  Didn't cancel my reservation until 3 hours after I was suppose to check in.  Wouldn't respond.  Changed my whole outlook on Airbnb.  Left me hanging and scrambling for lodging.  This host should not rent and if they are allowed to one should not use Airbnb.,20
35000795,"I usually giggle at the long, disgruntled, guest reviews on Airbnb... And now I'm posting one...

We stayed in Neh's place for a family weekend (my sister, my 70yr old mom and her partner). The location is fantastic--close to lots of great stuff and lots of life on the street. And the actual space is huge and beautiful with lots of potential. Unfortunately it was. Extremely disappointing...

The entire apartment seemed like it had never been cleaned. On the day if check-in (weeks after booking) it was finally disclosed to me that this is typically not a home but an office/work space. Neh called me and asked me that we tell anyone that asks that we are ""with the company"" and not mention Airbnb. Which isn't the strangest thing but it really made my elderly mother uncomfortable; like we were doing something illegal... 

As the space is not used as a home, it was in the condition of a space that isn't loved by anyone. Nothing was really clean except the brand new towels and sheets. We didn't have enough towels (the left us 2 sets and we booked for 4 people) and only fitted sheets were on the bed so we had to use the comforter directly... Which isn't the cleanest (Website hidden by Airbnb) one washes comforters after every use... 

Some of the windows had curtains but many did not, so privacy was a bit of a concern. The curtains that were there were filthy and the actual window sills were also filthy and rotting away from years of leaks. Any repairs done to them were quick and incomplete. Some of the windows didn't open and others didn't close; none of them had screens so the ones that were open when we got there stayed open and invited any bugs or critters that could scale the wall it fly in. 

The bathroom was very dirty. Empty bottles of Drano and soap pumps and a toilet brush, someone else's toiletries. Used toothpaste tube, and an empty flower pot were all strewn across the large window sill and made me feel like I was in a public bathroom. The shower was dirty and there was what looked like a rabbit poop (so probably rat poop) on the shower floor. The window curtain used to be white but is now grey, and the shower curtain was clean but other people's loofas were left in there. 

The description didn't mention anything about being on top of the bar, which is a huge oversight (probably intentional) because the music is pumping there until 4am. In fact, Neh asked us to make sure we keep the noise down after 9:30... Which is ridiculous--the bar was much louder than any noise we could make. The main bedroom is directly above that bar and it was impossible to sleep. The bedroom with bunk beds on the upper floor was better for the noise but I can't ask my 70yr old mom and her heavier-set partner to use the bunk beds. 

On the first night, when we got in from our day in the city just before midnight, we had no hot water. They refused to do anything about it the same night, stating they wouldn't be able to find someone to come in at that time, and said they will send someone over the next day. I'm a landlord in Montreal.. I know I can get someone to come in any day at any time if I need to so I thought this was a really poor response and terrible customer service. 

Neh told us someone would be in he next day, and when I mentioned that we planned to get an early start to the day, so we need showers early, she suggested we don't have to wait because they have a key to get in... But that wasn't our concern; we needed showers. We spent a hot day in a dirty city and skipping that shower would mean 48 hours if city grime... So we took cold showers... Including my tiny 70yr old mother...

They found out the next day that the hot water tank is shared with the bar downstairs so when they do their dishes (basically all night long) it empties the rank and never really has time to fill and warm up until the next morning. This is pretty unacceptable. Hot showers are the bare minimum when you're hosting guests... This makes me think we were their fita guests and their guinea pigs....

Overall I was very disappointed. I would never use this Airbnb again, stay at any of the hosts properties in the future, or recommend them to anyone. I think that a different crowd (maybe younger, maybe 30 is too old to tolerate these conditions) would be fine here, but it really needs to be advertised with more honesty, disclosing that it isn't a home and it is over a loud bar.

The positives: huge space, great location close to lots of life and public transportation, amazing vegan resto close by, free street parking (and safe--didnt even think of my car during those 3 days and 2 nights).",50
35000795,"I had a fun time in NY. The place was way larger than I originally imagined and it was in a fun location for us. The AC broke on the first night, which was EXTREMELY unfortunate—it was hard to sleep at night. But outside of that, thank you!",50

The host is trying to post the living room as a separate bedroom or studio which is completely false and fraudulent. 
After a long travel, we reached her place only to find out that we have been tricked!  It was a horrible experience. I had to cancel my reservation and find a new Airbnb.

They notified me that they would have to postpone my move-in day and put me at another residence, which was not cleaned prior to my arrival. The room was not similar in terms of the quality of the residences I selected on AirBnB. Specially, the room was extremely dusty with balls of collected dust on the window seals, under the bed and on the floor, and the window was covered with sheets of white paper. Additionally, the window seal was broken so it the noisy street prevented me from sleeping. They did not already change the bedding from the previous guest. All they did was give me a bag of new sheets to change myself without providing me with a clean blanket (Which I had to go walk to the laundry mat to wash myself). The bathroom was very hairy and cleaned only once throughout my 4 1/2 week stay even though 4 individuals stayed there. They also initially refused to give me a refund since they pushed back my first day even though I already paid for it. 

If I was aware of AirBnB’s policy, I would have filed my complaint regarding the room for full reimbursement and selected a new residence, but did not read the policy until the 24 hour period had passed.

35713354,"DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL ON Airbnb!! If you call the hotel directly the rates are A LOT cheaper. Please read this review prior to booking. This was my first time in NYC I was trying to get a really nice place. My  cousin and aunt were staying with me. My aunt is currently a Cancer patient and I was trying to do something nice for her in the city. The add on Airbnb was mis leading. The room isn’t as nice, the view from the window is anything like the picture in the add! One of the cabinets in the room wasn’t working properly. The room smelled like mold. These are just a few reasons not to book this room. 

Whoever the host is for this add posted the price for $666 a night. I stayed two nights and paid around $1300. Anticipating to stay in a VERY nice place for that price. When I called the hotel to confirm my reservation the day prior to checking in, the hotel told me the rates for the nights I’m staying are $281... Airbnb charged me $666!! That’s a HUGE up charge! 

On the Airbnb add is says the host is Park central hotel. Once I found out how much they were ripping me off I tried to contact the host to cancel the reservation, no one would respond to messages and when you would call the number on the add, no one would answer! Finally I sat down and let the phone ring for 25 minutes, someone picked up and said they’re a travel agency in MEXICO!! They advised me if I had any discrepancy I had to call Airbnb, I call Airbnb and they tell me I need to contact the host! I call the hotel for help but they can’t help me and tell me to contact Airbnb.. I’ve made soooo many attempts for assistance from the host in MEXICO! And have received none!This is definitely a scam! Plus when I checked out of the hotel they charged me an additional $262.50 due to fees and taxes.

To top it off, as I left, she immediately went into the bedroom and pulled off the bed sheets and accused me of making a stain on the mattress. Given that I did not pull off the sheets during the entire stay and the fact she immediately went for the bed when she entered the room, leads me to believe there is suspicious behavior.

36635518,"This was the worst air B and B experience I ever had and I will never book a shared stay again. Jill made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome the moment I moved in. I’ll start with saying that she was completely unprepared to host an air B and B guest. The kitchen was a mess. There was always a pile of dishes in the sink for days and sometimes they’d grow mold. I’d have to wash her moldy dishes just so I could use silverware.   The bathroom smelled like mildew and Jill never told me the basics such as where to throw out the trash and where I could do laundry, even though I asked her both of these things via text. After I stayed for less than a week, Jill asked me to provide toiletries for her- soap and toilet paper. (I thought this was included after paying a daily fee). I’m more than happy to buy toiletries for an extended stay, but it was incredibly rude in the manor that she asked me after barely living at her place for 5 days. 

Before I moved, I asked her about her guest policy and she agreed that I could have occasional guests. For context, I’m a responsible working  adult, and by guests I mean my younger brother who would only be occupying the room I was paying a lot of money to stay in for a few days while I was also there. She constantly changed her mind about the guest policy and said she felt uncomfortable with men in the house (understandable, but don’t change your policy after I already discussed this with you, payed and moved in). She asked me more than once during my stay if I was sneaking people into the apartment. This was INCREDIBLY offensive because it was something I’d never do. I was rarely in the apartment to begin with, unless I was sleeping and always made sure to be as quiet as possible. 

The bedroom was clean but if you want a kitchen that doesn’t have mold everywhere and supplied toiletries this is not the air B and B for you.",20
36665339,Yes this place is $35 a night but you’d expect basic stuff like heat in the winter and cleanliness. The bathroom and my room had roaches.

Then there was no heat one night when the temp went from 65 to 45. It just never came on. I told her and her response was to tell me to contact some other person was responsible for the heat. She new I was staying there with my 1 year old. She knew the temp was going to drop and just never contacted anyone to turn on the heat. My daughter and I had to sleep in the cold. I asked her to contact the person herself since she is the owner/ proprietor. I don’t know if she did. I tried and the “heat person” never answered me. I asked for a space heater when she told me the heat wouldn’t be fixed for two days and she never answered that. Then she told the old lady stay was living there to turn in the oven to heat up the place. The bathroom was backing up when you shower and someone left their wig drying in it. The old lady living there was  friendly and kind but on the last day I realized that she might not be all together since she peed herself (the inner legs of her pants were wet) and she acted like nothing happened. She went on for hours with the wet peed in pants. All together it wasn’t a nice experience. Stay at your own risk.,50

When I 1st arrived I put trash in the garbage in the kitchen and when I awoke he took the trash out and put it on the counter (rather the throwing it away). It sat there for 2 or 3 days so i said you know what let me throw this away. Now keep in mind when I arrived there was no instructions about recycling. VERY PETTY.  As I said previously he is NOT mean or nasty just childishly petty. His place is also not in the safest part of town either and he leaves the windows and doors unlocked leaving me to sleep with a knife in my bed. The place is not well kept either lots of work need to be done. So it's your choice if you want to take that chance. But if I were you I would stay away  from this place and this very STRANGE man.,30
37423816,"We would never recommend attempting to book with Dennis here’s why: 

My boyfriend and I booked two weeks in advance to stay for Labor Day weekend and he canceled our reservations the day before. We didn’t even see the message until we were on our way to NYC. Not only did Dennis ruin our plans he also gave us no reason as to why he canceled and claimed that it was a mutual cancelation when it wasn’t. He also canceled on two other people before us so I would highly suggest that you don’t book at all as he seems to be totally unreliable.",30

37524666,"I don't like to write negative reviews but I really DON'T recommend this apartment.  The pictures are deceiving. Among a ton of problems, the worst were that the cleaning person doesn't do very much (Shower was NEVER cleaned by them during my 6 weeks there.  2 times when he/she dropped by, all they did was take out the bottles...didn't even take out the trash), there were cockroaches, the internet drops here and there through the day, the apartment is not well-stocked (ie: 2 weeks where roommates had to buy own toilet paper; apartment has NO cleaning supplies),  and the manager is not helpful and terrible at communicating.   My roommates and I complained about these things multiple times.  If you complain enough, the manager will eventually help but I definitely did not have that kind of time or energy to follow-up with him....especially when the apartment has that many problems.  Also note that Ben and Christine are not the real apartment managers and they have nothing to do with the apartment once you move in.",40

Le escribo para preguntarle por qué miente? y me dice que lo rentó,cuando aquí sale que está disponible! y un día antes platicamos y no había dicho nada!!!!! yo ya venía en camino así que tuve que rentar otro lugar,airbnb me va a regresar el.dinero hasta dentro de 15 días!!! lo cual redujo mi presupuesto para mis vacsckones.

38000049,"The apartment is a beautiful, well-lit studio with a full kitchen, furniture and queen-size bed. There's a large flat screen TV with a built-in Roku, and enough space and seating and dishes to entertain a few guests. We had people over for dinner twice during our stay and they remarked favorably on the size, space, and style of the apartment. The bed is comfortable, but the blinds are far from blackout shades so buy a sleep mask or expect to rise with the sun. The WiFi was fast and reliable. There's a small grocery store less than a block away, and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods within a 15 minute walk. The 1/2/3 and A/B/C/D trains are also all within 15 minutes. The Hudson River Greenway and Riverside Park are a 5 minute walk away if you like running and biking. 

NOISE NOTE: (other reviews have noted this and Emily DM'ed to let us know this also, so this is just informational, not a criticism) there is ongoing construction between 8AM and 8PM on weekdays. Noise from the construction varies from minimal if a bit annoying (much of the time) to jackhammer-demolishing-the-apartment-immediately-above (occasionally). Do not depend on having a space during weekday business hours where you can hear yourself think. Elevator service is also seriously degraded during weekday business hours due to construction workers using all three elevators to ferry supplies up and down.",50

He then changed his mind without telling me and told me I had to leave. He handled this situation in a poor and unprofessional manner. 
Supplies you will need to take:

The bathroom does not have any paper towels or hand towels and no soap to wash your hands.

There were 3 people staying there and no toilet paper in the bathroom so I ran out and bought some.

Take a can of Raid Roach Killer  because you will need it when you go into the kitchen. He does not take out the garbage daily so there are bugs. Also spray your room so they don't get in your luggage

He responded by saying that one light per room is good enough, and that if I don't want my phone to die then I shouldn't be on it so much. It was extremely rude and uncalled for. Not only that, but I also had a random guy walking in and out of my room during the night. Apparently someone else also sleeps in the back section of the room but it wasn't at all advertised. Me being a woman, I never have felt so unsafe in my life. I would suggest looking elsewhere for accommodations, because this is definitely not worth the price.",20

Our trip was basically ruined because we had no place to stay it was very inconvenient for us and upsetting since we paid a lot and had planed it for weeks in advance. Expect to not be welcome at all, the bathrooms were dirty and rooms basically empty with no privacy at all. I do not recommend this place.",20

Bien que nous ayons apprécié l'emplacement et la vue depuis l'appartement, le logement était vraiment très sale. Lorsque nous sommes arrivés, nous avons découvert que l'appartement n'était pas aussi étincelant que prévu : l'évier de la cuisine était bouché par un amat de nourriture, la poubelle de la cuisine débordait de déchets tout comme celle de la salle de bain, le sol de la cuisine était recouvert de tâche de gras, et il y avait plusieurs cheveux sur les rebords de la baignoire. De plus lorsque nous sommes arrivés nous avons dû faire nous-mêmes notre lit, et ce, dans une chambre où les draps des anciens locataires traînaient par terre. Durant ce voyage, nous pensions pouvoir économiser de l'argent en mangeant à l'appartement mais étant donné la saleté et le manque d'équipement, nous avons passé notre temps à manger à l'extérieur. Heureusement qu'il y avait des restaurants pas trop loin dans le quartier. Je ne conseille donc pas ce logement sauf pour les ppersonnes capables de mettre leur hygiène de côté.",40

When we finally reached some random guy (not Christian himself), he stated he can't do anything for us and that's what the listing said.

39385330,"I wanted to like the place. I booked the place for 30 days but had to leave after 1 night. I was told by the co-host Victoria that Shay just had a new child and has been busy lately, which I understand, but some of the issues I had were unacceptable. 

1. You should note that most, if not all, of Victoria and Shay's listings are from the same home. This means you would share the home with many other tenants/guests. This is something you should really keep in mind if you are looking to book a place during this covid-19 outbreak. I needed an affordable place that is close to work and I would've been ok with sharing space with a few people. Not 5+ people. 
2. The cleanliness of the place was not acceptable, even though they say they clean regularly. They definitely do not clean the communal refrigerators. You should bring your own house slippers or you'll have to wear socks throughout the whole house. That's all I'll say about that. 
3. Kitchen downstairs is in need of an upgrade or repair. There's only 1 working stove-top, the kitchen faucet is broken, and there is no microwave. You can use the kitchen upstairs which is fully built out, but that means you could come into contact with many more people which is something to think about if you're staying during covid-19. 
4. The hosts were communicative before check-in, but stopped replying after I brought up my issues.",40
39414449,"This apartment does NOT include access to any building amenities!  No gym. No pool. No bbq area.  Zeus said in the listing that it comes with access to all those things, and it does not.  The building itself is managed by a different company and they do not provide access to anyone whose name is not on the lease.  We received multiple messages from Zeus that this problem had been sorted out, but every time we talked to the building about getting access, they said no.  We stayed here for an entire month and this problem was NEVER resolved.  
We also got an eviction notice because the building management doesn't approve of sub-leasing apartments in their building--fortunately for us, the eviction date was after our check-out date.  So there is a good chance that no one is reading this review because this apartment may not be rented anymore.

The backyard was used by the upstairs dogs to do their ""business"" (nobody picked anything up after them!), be careful not to step in anything when you come here in Summer. Also the outside furniture looked very ""used"".

The location close to different Subway Stations, Busses and small shops was great and so was the comfortable bed. We did not need a closet since we only had carry on luggage but I can imagine it to be a little complicated when you travel with a bigger suitcase and you have no place other than a tiny drawer to put your clothes. The heat in the room worked great but the bathroom was freezing, especially after taking a shower. 

Speaking of the bathroom, it was very dirty. The shower curtain had big mold stains on them and there was hair everywhere. The little carpet  out of the shower had a lot of white stains/spots and the handle to turn on the shower was broken. You had to adjust the perfect temperature before you entered the shower because with wet hands there was no way to change anything (too slippery!). The toilet flooded at the end of our stay (somebody was flushing used floss for your teeth down all the time, we saw it floating around in the bowl). The sink and even the hand soap had hair on it. Very disgusting!

We didn't use much of the common areas or the kitchen but from what we saw it looked crammed. The fridge definitely needs cleaning and the trash was always full. A lot of stuff laying around everywhere and all shelves full of books and random things.

There was supposed to be wifi but we didn't get it to work for the entire stay. We asked the Host for the network name and the password but were only told that it's behind the couch. Well, we did find a router but the name and password displayed on it didn't match any of the available networks. Trust me, we tried them all! 

There were some issues with the host/ the roommate. We were accused to have left our stuff outside of the room in the common areas (even if that was not US but the OTHER new roommate) and we where rudely woken up the day of our departure. Yes they did apologize but come on two occurrences like this in 5 days? You may have had bad experiences with previous guests but that doesn't mean that you can wake us up like this, knocking the door as if you want to break it at 8 am and then telling us that we had to leave the day before when that's not true! As an excuse we were told that they ""mixed up the dates"". Besides those two occurrences the communication with the host was okay (even if we never got the wifi to work and had to use a hotspot outside the apartment).

We never met Summer but there were two other people living in this apartment (1 male & 1 female). The apartment is kind of noisy in the morning with opening/closing doors and creaky wooden floors but that stopped around 9 am when everybody left.

The Area around the house is nice and felt safe, even at night. One day we took a walk all the way towards the Brooklyn Bridge and across it to Lower Manhattan, it took us around 2-3 hours. The (2) and (3) train takes you ""home"" even at night.",40

Definitely be careful when outside and make sure to carry pepper spray or something. The C train is about a 15 minute walk from the house. The host was out of town but had a great response time and was super helpful during my stay, her two roommates were in the home and they were both very nice as well. Overall you get what you pay for and it wasn’t terrible but it would probably be better to spend a bit more for a clean place in a safer area",50
40678848,"The host was late to give us the keys, the whole Airbnb wasn’t cleaned (beds unmade and unwashed, kitchen sink full of dishes, living area and bathroom not wiped down), the toilet was broken (wouldn’t flush), WiFi info provided didn’t work, no utensils in the kitchen and TV had no remote so we could use it. Wouldn’t recommend this Airbnb to anyone until they fix somethings, but the location was perfect!",40
40678848,"Unresponsive host, had my group wait an hour before we were able to get the keys to our place and ended up giving us the wrong keys. Very unprofessional, would not recommend.",40
40678848,"I'll start out with the place was immaculate when we arrived. We got the key from a restaurant on the street which was fine/easy. We were only in town for one night and really just needed a place to put our bags and to sleep in order to attend a concert at night. So this AirBnB was okay for that, especially considering the price for the time of year. 

However, after that, there are little positives. First thing we encountered was that the toilet wouldn't flush. We tried to fix it ourselves because the tank wasn't filling with water but it was no use - new parts are needed. The host provided a number that was to the restaurant we got they key from. The mailbox was full the entire time and we didn't have time to sit around and wait for someone to call back. We left multiple messages on the app to see if we could contact the renter there. 

Next - the heat! There was a thermostat in the apartment which was off/set to as low as possible but the place was still unbearably hot in December. We had to have all windows open, which was a little unsettling as the fire escape under the front windows led straight to the main street. The building must regulate heat on it's own  and the thermostat has little to no actual function. 

Lastly, we didn't receive any information/contact for how to check out. We had buses to catch and called the restaurant again to ask what to do with the key/trash. The mailbox was still full so we had to make the decision to leave the key in the apartment. 

Overall, this place was good for what we needed, but I wouldn't recommend a stay any longer than a night.",40

40772134,"Pictures of this place are spot on! Beautiful  and cozy apartment with awesome decor. Location is great and in a safe neighborhood. Had some issues upon arrival as check in instructions are not very clear. The lockbox to obtain the key was in an obscure location that was not communicated to us before arrival. Be prepared to walk up 5 flights of stairs with your luggage! Pack light or you’re in for quite a workout! Very comfortable bed, but made a run to Target to get new sheets and pillowcases as the sheets didn’t appear very clean. The television in the living room did not work/connect to the Apple TV box. Messaged the host about this issue and didn’t receive a response. I also messaged the host about a late checkout of an hour later and also didn’t receive a response. All in all, decent accommodations at an awesome price. Would recommend as long as the host worked out a few of the aforementioned kinks.",40
40775503,"This is hands down the worst airbnb experience I have ever had. I have stayed in many apartments around the city and this is the worst. The host ignored all of my messages and calls leading up to my arrival. Not until I was in baggage claim at the airport did I receive a reply from Achraf. I had no knowledge of how to check in until I was taking a taxi to the apartment. The view from the apartment was beautiful. However only one tv worked, there didn't seem to be heat ( thankfully it wasn't too cold) and the toilet was broken. We informed the person who checked us in and he said it would be fixed. Nothing was. We had to take the lid off and flush the toilet manually all week. No communication happened the entire time I stayed. I feel like this host is only interested in making money and not providing quality service which I am accustomed to with airbnb. I DO NOT RECOMMEND STAYING WITH THIS HOST!!!!!!!!!!!",40
40784945,"Please pay attention to the guest’ needs especially if the weather is so cold, and fix the heat.

40784945,"Overall, my stay was okay. The bedroom was clean and spacious. However, the bathroom tub needed to be cleaned. Even though the stove couldn’t be utilized there is a lot of storage space in the fridge and a microwave.

40800295,"We advised James that we would be having a New Years party with 35 people by his loft. He asked we be out and cleaned by 2:00AM.He helped out to start and was helpful in the beginning. However when the event started, besides allowing us to enjoy our New Years, James decided to interfere and be at the loft while we were having a party constantly intruding in our small event which consisted of married couples. He was acting like an unwanted parent at a party. He kept picking up everyone’s drinks after we explained several times we will take care of it. He was excessively looking around to see how much each party member was drinking. And on top of all this toward 12:30AM he completely collapsed and started cursing and yelling at our guests. This is when we asked him urgently to leave us in the place we rented alone. It got worse at the end of the night constantly harassing my guests and cursing with the most disgusting language. We stayed back after the party and cleaned up everything because james forcibly made us seem as if we were the once supposed to do a full spot  cleaning when we are paying for an over priced listing and paying a $250 cleaning fee! Nothing was broken nor damaged and he just fought and screamed at me who stayed to sweep  the floor. I ADVISE YOU THIS IS NOT A PERSON WHO YOU SHOULD RENT FROM OR EVEN BE IN CONTACT WITH .

However, this is an AirBnB hotel. Secondly, there was no soap in the whole house. Senol said someone stole it. Then it seems that someone kept a copy of the house key... so I guess they can walk in anytime. A perfect excuse that if a theft happens... it’s not the owners fault. Third, the thermostat is on the second floor (main corridor) of the house. Hot air rises and the rooms on the second floor have large windows (some without radiators) - so they are cool. And there are no quilts. So you will be cold at night. Foreign guests, prepare to freeze and have your stuff stolen. Everything here feels like a setup.",20

Upon arrival, we realized that the pictures and verbal representation of the rental were very misleading, as it turned out to be a much smaller (solitary) room with 3 sets of bunk beds setup practically on top of each other and a tiny balcony with a poor view. The only accurate picture was of the bathroom, which was actually decent. Otherwise, we came back from an evening out to find a random man had been allowed into our room (due to their hostel/""dormitory""-style of renting) with our personal belongings and was sleeping in one of our beds, despite the fact we had rented the room for ourselves. We were switched to a ""better room"", which was actually smaller and had a door lock that didn't even work. We checked out at 5 AM to head home as we didn't feel safe.

42155687,"Hi! Helaine,

Unfortunately our stay at your location was not the best experience we’ve had while visiting NYC.

We had arrived at the location on Monday March 2nd at 5PM and we could not access the link you sent. We did not have the code for the outside door for the self check in. Bruna had given us only the access code for the room without the room number and outside door access code. We sent you a couple of messages from 5PM till 8PM with no response. Fortunately other tenants passed by and let us come in the appartement and we could access our room only by trying our room code supplied by Bruna on the different doors.

The worst part of this trip was when 2 guys came in our room during the night at 3:30AM telling us we were in there room and to get out. I needed to argue my point and they finally decided to leave after an hour of negotiating with them.

Can you explain how this could happen? They had the access code to come in the room.
 
I sent you another message with still no reply. We did not get any reply from you or your co-hosts before Tuesday at 8 AM.

We did  not feel safe in this environment so we decided to leave the premises and I sent you a final request for a refund on which you you still have not replied yet.

Frankly, for my first time on AirBNB this was the worst.

Regards,

Erik Beaulieu",20

42280136,"Do Not Stay Here
This place is filthy gross. I was here for almost two months and ended up having to clean it myself. 

The walls were blackened with grime. The scum on the shower tiles was so thick you could scratch a line in it with your fingernail. There’s mold in there too and the shower curtain is slimy. Don’t get me started on the rest of the place.

He books out two rooms and I legit witnessed that he never cleaned the blanket on the bed between guests. Plus, he didn’t initially disclose the presence of a surveillance device and then declined to say where it was when asked. 

Yes, all this was politely brought up in the moment. His words when he saw his paying guest cleaning the hallway walls that were covered in ... something... “It’s not that dirty.” He fully recognises that it’s nasty, he just doesn’t care. 

He can live however he likes, but he has no right to expect paying guests to live in his filth with him. 

And that’s just the cleanliness. There’s more wrong with the place and the guy. I mean, look, you just need a place to crash after a wild night out, do you. But maybe bring a sleeping bag and shower shoes.  Btw, the bed in the smaller room is the bottom part of a children’s bunk bed. I’m 5’6” and my feet hung off the end. ✌",20

42412690,"There were some red flags raised from the start - Tricia contacted me after I reserved her apartment saying she didn’t know it was available to book, and a week before I came to “make sure I was still planning to come.” 

The day before I checked in she asked me to tell neighbors that I was a friend, not an Airbnb guest, if they asked in order to “avoid any issues.” 

I left during the covid crisis partway through my reservation and she said she would refund part of the stay which I really appreciated, but then she said Airbnb was having issues so she couldn’t process it but that she would keep trying. After receiving no response to numerous messages from Tricia I contacted Airbnb who said she refused the refund. 

It was her prerogative to do so, but I don’t have a lot of respect for people who aren’t willing to have honest communication, she could have just told me...and I certainly wouldn’t recommend her as a host.",20

There was a Smell so foul, I think emitted from one of the radiators I had to leave the apartment for 24 hours and air it out. The hosts were not eager to help, and I had to be patient and persistent with them to get anything done. They didn’t want to send the Super or come over to fix anything, and used COVID as an excuse, yet they brought prospective tenants over, without asking. Pathetic. It was extremely stressful, and normally I would have left very soon, which was recommended by people I spoke to, but I had a lot of baggage and I didn’t want to be moving around during the pandemic. I told them I would be vacating 2 days early and then one of them came over and starting cursing at me and trying to throw my bags out. She even called the cops and said there was “an intruder” and I was “being intimidating.” Unbelievable. After I already said I was leaving and had my bags packed.
